# HAT FORMAT:
# Each entry represents a unique hat. If the entry is changed, the hat will not work anymore.
# Entries are presented IN ORDER to the GUI. This means that to change the ordering,
# you should cut and paste the specified hat to an earlier position in this config.
# For each entry, the options are:
# [REQUIRED] item: the material to set the item
# [REQUIRED] name: the display name of the hat in inventories
# [OPTIONAL] lore: a list of strings to display as the item lore
# [OPTIONAL] glow: true/false - should this item glow?
# [OPTIONAL] requirements: A list of requirements that should all be met
#                          for the player to be able to use this hat
# [OPTIONAL] frames: A list of frames for this hat. Include this option
#                    to make this hat animated.
#
# Requirements format:
#   permissions: A list of permissions the player must have
#   placeholders: If PAPI is installed, a list of placeholder requirements
#                 format: "%placeholder%[compare][value]"
#                 [compare] can be one of > >= = <= <
#                 [value] can be a number, string, or another placeholder
#                 Strings can only be compared with "="!
#   hats: A list of other hats the player must also own
#         !!! DO NOT MAKE HATS THAT REQUIRE EACH OTHER. YOU WILL BREAK YOUR SERVER. !!!
#   cost: An economy cost that the player must pay to own this hat.
#         The item is not buyable until all other requirements are met.
# 
# Frames format:
#   Each frame is another entry that supports item, name, lore, glow etc
#   each entry must also have a "time" key that specifies the frame's
#   duration in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second).
#   Frames are played in order and then looped.
#   Each frame can also be a playerhead or banner!
#
# If the item is a PLAYER_HEAD:
# Include the head's VALUE from your favorite head website.
# You should be able to find this in whatever head page there is.
# Then, include it in the head config as value: "[put value here]"
#
# If the item is a BANNER:
# First, make sure the item name is colored, e.g. GREEN_BANNER
# Next, go to your favorite banner generator site and find the /give code
# Then, copy the code from where it says "Patterns:" to the end.
# Include this in the head config as patterns: "[paste here]"
#
# Note that banners and playerheads don't support the glow option
# Examples of blocks, banners, and playerheads can all be found below!
